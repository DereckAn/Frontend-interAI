That means there are times when things may not be fleshed out perfectly or designs aren‚Äôt quite 100% polished when we need to start moving on something ‚Äî just had to warn you up front, but you‚Äôre probably the kind of person who enjoys that kind of early-stage challenge :)\n\n\nWhat you'll do\n\n\n\nYou will QA Mindsmith's core features and collaborate with experienced engineers to build features. \n\n\n\nA few good things to know:\n\n\nOur team is small but powerful; you wouldn't believe what we've built in a short amount of time.
